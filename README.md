OpenEdit FSED

This is I believe the last version I worked on.  I will attempt to upload the compiled zip file for you as well which will work on all the DOS BBS's.
There are some bugs in this version that were caused by me removing the copy protection a previous author must have spent years on.
Sometimes the taglines won't save to a message
sometimes the config gets corrupted (just delete the config and reconfgiure) 

Other then that I have been using it for years and it works great - a windows native port would be amazing if possible, same with
prting to linux for the possibilty of adding to new opensource bbs'.
